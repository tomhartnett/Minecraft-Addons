# "Tom's Buildings" Minecraft Add-on
This is an add-on for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. It is a behavior pack that adds building-creating functions to your world.

### Included Functions
- `hut1` Builds a small hut with a window and door.
- `building5` Builds a 5-story building with quarts blocks and gray stained glass windows.
- `building10` Builds a 10-story tower.
- `erase` Fills a 40x40 area from y=4 up through y=255 with air.
- `nuke` Fills a 110x110 area from your current y up through y=255 with air.

**Example usage.**
```
/function hut1
```

### Build
Run the following commands from the terminal:
```
% zip -rX Toms-Buildings.zip Toms-Buildings
% mv Toms-Buildings.zip Toms-Buildings.mcpack

```

### Install
Tap on the `.mcpack` file on your iPad.  There are various ways to get the file on your iPad:
- AirDrop it (my favorite)
- Add it to iCloud Drive and then browse to it on the iPad using the Files app
- Email it as an attachment
